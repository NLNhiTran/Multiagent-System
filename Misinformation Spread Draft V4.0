## ACKNOWLEDGMENT

This is the first version built of our group under the the Agent-Based Modelling and Simulation Project Assignment. 

This model uses the epiDEM Basic model as the base and incrementally built upon it with variously new components and desired features added to it for the research topic of interest over educational impact and solution to COVID 19 misinformation spread. 

## WHAT IS IT?

What is it about?
 
This model simulates the spread of misinformation in a hypothetical population during the pandemic of COVID 19.The model describes the dynamics of a mix population of people with different education levels in a society, where individuals are harmed by false news, misinformation and non-sensical conspiracy theories at different rates. The model describes the phenomenon where misinformation emerges when one misinformed person starts spreading false news to this wholly susceptible population. 

What motivates us on working on this topic?

While COVID 19 spreads aggressively and rapidly across the world, many people have been witnessing heart-wrenching life-turning unexpected events where their closest ones leave them forever. Yet, there is an ongoing general mass suspicion among people that if COVID 19 does really exist. Due to misperceptions and lack of understanding, riots have arisen to protest against the government measures, which in turns prolonging the pandemic. Mix of opinions slow down the vaccination rate and case surge threatens hospital capacity worldwide. Hence our group set sights on simulating misinformation spread under educational impact in light of the COVID 19 pandemic. 

What are the assumptions?

This model assumes a mixed population between two groups of people: people at relatively higher education level and people at relatively lower education level. 
It also assumes that each individual within this population has a risk of being susceptible to fake news and proganda. They can be affected by one another via their own  network, which can be online or offline. There is also homogeneous mixing, in that each person in the world has the same chance of interacting with any other person within the same group of people. In terms of beliefs, the model assumes that there are a difference in the level of knowledge, awareness and abilities to analyze facts between the people with more advantageous educational background compared to others. For example, people that are highly educated are less likely belive in false news compared to less educated people. Similarly the same things happen when it comes to analyze the same piece of facts. People with less of an education background are less likely to be corrected from false news as well. 

This model incorporates all of the above assumptions, each hi-ed (relatively highly educated people) individual has a 10% chance of being initialized as misinformed and each lo-ed (relatively lowly educated people) individual has a 20% chance of being initialized as posessing the false news. 

What is the purpose of this model?
Overall, this model helps users
1) Simulate a real-world situtation where people can freely interact with people within their network of people, susceptible to misinformation and given chances to correct their knowledge. 
2) Measure and evaluate the effect of having more educated people in a population to tackle the misinformation spread issue. 
3) Examine how long does it take in general to correct the entire population which has been undergoing a misinformation pandemic. 
4) Understanding the interactions between agents and experiment different techniques to build a NetLogo model. Apply the knowledge learned to systematically analyze different measures and model outcomes. 
5) Provide opportunities to extend the model to evaluate other different relevant factors that might intrigue the research topic purpose. 

## HOW IT WORKS

When the model is first set up there are two different agents; initial high educated agent and initiallow educated agents. A propotion of people from both group get asisgned with carrying some piece of fake news. Everyon starts moving around at random speed and random direction with time steps measured in days. Each tick counts as one day passes by.
Upon coming into contact with another neighbors within his/her contacts (same-breed and cross-breed), by being in any of the eight surrounding neighbors of a misinformed person or in the same location, the initially neutral (not yet misinformed neither corrected) person  has a chance of getting the fake news and assigned  with a probability to believe in this fake news based on his/her group nature (hi-ed or lo-ed). The misinformed person can also be assigned with a chance to being corrected from this fake news. They can start seeking to facts to verify themselves or getting in touch with another neighbors (same-breed and cross-breed). The correction time represent the amount of time that it takes for the person to do some fact checking and complete get corrected and get passed this fake news or suspicions. 

The user can set the number of initial people from both groups in the world, the average correction time as well as their probability of being misinformed and/or being corrected.

The colors of the individuals indicate their respective education levels and misinformation status. To here are 6 different colors assigned the agents.

- White (lo-ed) and Yellow (hi-ed) are neutral individuals neither being misinformed nor corrected  (set at beginning)
- Blue (lo-ed) and Green (hi-ed) are fact-checking and corrected person
- Grey (lo-ed) and Orange (hi-ed) are a misinformed person

Beneath these first sliders, two different graphs are plotted:
- The cumulative misinformed and corrected agents, split further into the initial high and low educated agents.
- The population, plotting the total amount of agents over time.

At last we can see, next to the running model;
- Total amount of misformed initial high educated agents
- Total amount of corrected initial high educated agents
- Total amount of misformed initial low educated agents
- Total amount of corrected initial low educated agents

## HOW TO USE IT

SETUP creates a number of individuals according to the parameter values chosen by the user. GO starts the model and runs it continuously until the entire population are fully corrected after getting affected by the fake news.

Time-step considered for this model is in days, although any suitable time unit will do, the group agrees that misinformation and correction should happen on daily basis. 

Below is a summary of the sliders in the model.

INITIAL-HI-ED and INITIAL-LO-ED The amount of initial high and low educated agents, the amount change has a range of 0 to 200.
SPREAD-CHANCE (10 - 100) The probability of an initial high and low educated agent becoming misformed, range 0 to 100.
HI-CORRECTION-CHANCE and LO-CORRECTION-CHANCE (10 - 100) The probability of an initial high and low educated agent becoming corrected, meaning that they are not misformed anymore, range 0 to 100.
HI-AVERAGE-CORRECTED-TIME and LO-AVERAGE-CORRECTED-TIME (50 - 300): Number of days that it takes before the piece of false news gets corrected for each individual.

## THINGS TO NOTICE

Even though the education level is an important factor we cannot exactly say that lower education leads to this problem. It is also the same for the correction of misinformation. Time is another factor in our model that we took from the real world because it can be said that higher educated people are more likely to have highly educated people who can reach or have the correct information so that could affect the average correction time. The graphs and the monitors are  making the model whole since we need to understand it easily. Even a person who has a limited knowledge could look at the model and see the result and make some assumptions about it.


## EXTENDING THE MODEL

Due to the above things that were noticed, this base model can be extended further by building additional settings to cover the assumptions made above over differences in spread chance, correction chance and average corrected time between both breeds of agents and see what the results are.

It is also noticed and worth trying to extend the model by plotting different countries with diffenrent amount of hi-ed and lo-ed on the same world to project a direct comparison view. 

## RELATED MODELS

This base model has been actually extended further taking into consideration of the above ideas.
